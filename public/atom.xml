    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="who-wants-to-talk-about-development-stuff?">who wants to talk about development stuff?</h3><p>If you go to <a href="http://www.meet-up.com/" target="_blank">meetup.com</a> and search for developer meet-ups, depending on where you are in the country you will see dozens of different meet-ups available for all flavours, variations and discipline of developer. With one small caveat the majority are based in a city.</p>
<p>As a developer who would like to talk to other developers about development, this posed a problem for me. Being based in Hastings the amount of time it would take to travel to these meet-ups made attending any very difficult. So I had an idea; Why not set-up a local developer meet-up. A developer meet-up in Hastings, so devtings.</p>
<p>That&#39;s as far as I&#39;ve got so far, an idea (and a domain, and an <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=devtings" target="_blank">IRC channel</a>). This blog post will be about the thoughts and assumptions I&#39;ve had regarding the setting up the meet-up, and as we move forward my plan is to blog about the reality of it.</p>
<h3 id="meet-ups-in-theory">meet-ups in theory</h3><p>One of the things I have realised is that a local dev meet-up can&#39;t be the same as a larger meet-up. Firstly you can&#39;t be too specific in your topics and audience. A meet-up like <a href="http://www.meet-up.com/Functional-Brighton/" target="_blank">Functional Brighton</a> would be too specific to build a regular meet-up around, however talks and discussion about functional programming would make a great contribution. A good model I think for this is podcasting. A podcast like <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank">.Net Rocks!</a> will cover various different aspects and disciplines of development. Then with guest experts to deliver some deep insight into the topics covered.</p>
<h3 id="presentations">presentations</h3><p>With a local meet-up it will be more difficult to get a wide variety of industry experts to come and give presentations. But there is opportunity in that as well. There will be people who want to be industry experts, who want to be a presenter at conferences a local meet-up would give them a place to practice, develop their skills and hopefully be a stepping stone for them. The other opportunity is for regular members of the meet-up to give their own presentations. Again this gives people an opportunity to develop their own skills and confidence.</p>
<h3 id="other-items-of-business">Other items of business</h3><p>Although the presentations will be an important part of the meet-up, they will not be the only part. The meet-up should be a relaxed environment where developers can discuss anything they want. Structure is important so people know what to expect but at the same time things need to be flexible and if this is going to be a successful venture it needs to grow organically.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-this-all-going-to-cost?">How much is this all going to cost?</h3><p>The costs of a meet-up. Costs are something that can grow and grow quickly. Starting off with organisation; you need an online presence you can point people to. Then with a place people can go it needs to be followed up with some promotion. Venues, food and drink, guest speakers; all these things cost money. So while this idea is getting off the ground we&#39;ll ignore them. Keep costs low, see if there is an interest and build from there.</p>
<h3 id="what-we&#39;ve-got-and-what-we-need">what we&#39;ve got and what we need</h3><p>So far we have a domain (<a href="http://www.devtings.net/" target="_blank">devtings.net</a>) and thanks to <a href="http://www.alexhitchins.co.uk/" target="_blank">Alex Hitchins</a> an IRC channel <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=devtings" target="_blank">#devtings</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pre-meet-up-meet-up">pre-meet-up-meet-up</h3><p>So far I&#39;ve floated the idea to a few developers I know and work with and have got a positive response. So the next step, it&#39;s to get a few more devs and go to the pub. Start fleshing out some ideas, see what others can contribute and lets take a bunch of devs living in Hastings and start building a community of developers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Something I noticed while digging around in bootstrap was how they added a point to a dropdown menu. I thought I&#39;d demo a simplified version of the steps to get there. In Bootstrap the point is created using a pseudo element and also takes advantage of <code>background-clip</code>, but I&#39;ll be keeping things simple here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with an element (div) and add a border</li>
<li>Each side of the border is connected at either end by a mitre joint. This is what is taken advantage of To create the pointer look.</li>
<li>The height and width of an element is the internal size of that element, the border is calculated on top of that. So the border will still be drawn even when the height and width are both set to 0. I&#39;ve also increased the size of the border here.</li>
<li>Final step is to make 3 of the sides transparent and the <code>background-color</code> transparent. This leaves you with a pointer.</li>
</ol>
<p>You don&#39;t have to have an equilateral triangle, by changing the widths of the 2 adjacent sides you can create a variety of triangular shapes. The demos all have a <code>border-top-width</code> of 20px.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First up here is Kevin Marks&#39; talk on &quot;the web we found&quot;; the web 10 years ago, the web today and the future of the web at LeWeb&#39;13.</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ve48PjgDAn0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The talk starts by looking at the web in 2003 and a compares it to the web in 2013. This was just the background and foundation to lay out the ideas of the indie web and the future of the web.</p>
<h3 id="the-bit-i-found-really-relevant">The bit I found really relevant</h3><p>When Marks was discussing the future of the web one of the points that resonated with me was about building tools that you want to use. I think this idea will colour most of the decisions about how this blog engine is developed (for now). It&#39;s easy to go down a rabbit hole of second guessing what other people want in a tool. But while it&#39;s just me, I&#39;ll stick to a few rules of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the core development, I&#39;m not going to worry too much about breaking what I already have.</li>
<li>With one big caveat, when I update the the distribution version of the engine that is powering this blog I&#39;m not going to overwrite any theming or content I already have here.</li>
<li>Going from writing a new post to publishing, I want that to take minimal steps. Ideally one but I&#39;ve not decided on grunt powered commits.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bonus-feature">Bonus Feature</h3><p>Here is a follow-up interview with Kevin Marks where he discuss and expands on some of the ideas from his presentation and gives a bit of background on the history of video and the web.</p>
