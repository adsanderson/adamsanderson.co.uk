The talk starts by looking at the web in 2003 and a compares it to the web in 2013. This was just the background and foundation to lay out the ideas of the indie web and the future of the web.

### The bit I found really relevant

When Marks was discussing the future of the web one of the points that resonated with me was about building tools that you want to use. I think this idea will colour most of the decisions about how this blog engine is developed (for now). It's easy to go down a rabbit hole of second guessing what other people want in a tool. But while it's just me, I'll stick to a few rules of thumb:

 - In the core development, I'm not going to worry too much about breaking what I already have.
 - With one big caveat, when I update the the distribution version of the engine that is powering this blog I'm not going to overwrite any theming or content I already have here.
 - Going from writing a new post to publishing, I want that to take minimal steps. Ideally one but I've not decided on grunt powered commits.

### Bonus Feature

Here is a follow-up interview with Kevin Marks where he discuss and expands on some of the ideas from his presentation and gives a bit of background on the history of video and the web.
